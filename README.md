	<h1>README for 42 Core Curriculum Projects</h1>
<p>Welcome to my repository containing all of the projects I completed as part of the 42 Core Curriculum! Each project is designed to challenge me in a specific area of software development and help me develop the skills needed to become a successful programmer.</p>

<h2>Directory Structure</h2>
<p>Each project is organized in its own directory and contains a <code>README.md</code> file with information about the project and how to run it. The directories are named according to the project name and the language or technology used.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Each project has its own set of requirements, which are listed in the project's <code>README.md</code> file. Please make sure you have the necessary software and dependencies installed before attempting to run any of the projects.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with a project, simply navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the <code>README.md</code> file. Each project is designed to be self-contained, so you should be able to run it without any additional setup or configuration.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>If you find any issues with any of the projects, or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!</p>

<h2>License</h2>
